# ü§ñ Multi-AI Chat Platform 

This project is a fully frontend-based **Multi-AI Chat** application that provides access to multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models through a single interface.  
Users can select the AI model they want to interact with, send queries, and instantly view responses.  
**No backend is used** ‚Äì all API calls are made directly from the frontend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onuryerlikaya/multi-ai-chat.git
cd multi-ai-chat
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üîë API Keys (.env)

Create a `.env` file like the following:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_xxxx
VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_CUSTOM_AI_KEY=optional
```

> This platform **supports any AI model for which an API key is provided**.  
Only AI APIs with CORS permission will work directly in the frontend.

## ü§ñ Supported AI Models

| AI Platform        | Status     | Description                                   |
|--------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI GPT         | ‚úÖ Active with API key | GPT-3.5, GPT-4, DALL¬∑E 3                 |
| HuggingFace        | ‚úÖ Active with API key | gpt2, mistral-7b, etc.                   |
| Mistral            | ‚úÖ Active with API key | Mistral models (inference API)          |
| Claude / Anthropic | üîê May work via proxy with API key |
| Gemini / Google    | üîê No public API yet, may be added later |
| Poe, Grok, XAI     | ‚ùå Platform-specific only               |

> ‚úÖ The list can be extended with any supported model via API key.

## üß† How It Works

1. User selects an AI model from the interface.
2. Types a message and sends it.
3. The frontend makes a `fetch()` request to the appropriate AI API.
4. The response is displayed instantly in the chat panel.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a demo project. API key security should be handled carefully when used in the frontend. For production use, it is recommended to implement a backend or proxy server.
